# Monocular (Inertial) Visual Odometry for Drones

This project focuses on developing a monocular (inertial) visual odometry system for drone navigation. The goal is to provide accurate and robust localization capabilities using only visual and inertial sensor data. 
Please Understand that this is an ongoing project and some files may be missing.


## Overview

Monocular (inertial) visual odometry is a technique that combines information from a single camera and inertial sensors to estimate the drone's motion and position. This repository implements a system that leverages these sensors to achieve reliable and precise navigation for drones. At the current state, the project produces a translation error or 1.2% and a rotation error of 0.015째/m on KITTI dataset ana a translation error of 1.8% on the TELLO DJI dron


## Installation

Follow these steps to install and set up the monocular (inertial) visual odometry system:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Yacynte/Monocular-Visual-Odometry.git`
2. Install dependencies: OpenCV, numpy, matplotlib, tqdm `pip install -r docs/requirements.txt`


[Detailed Installation Guide](./docs/installation.md)


## Usage

To use the monocular (inertial) visual odometry system with your drone, follow these steps:

1. Provide input images and inertial sensor in the Tello, UE or KITTI dataset folder in the same syntax as the other folders.
2. Add the name of your folder in vo_gui.py
3. Run the main script: `vo_gui.py`
4. Configure the system parameters in the `gui`.
5. Start the algorithm.

[Example Usage](./docs/example_mvio.mp4)


## Configuration

Customize the behavior of the system by modifying the parameters in the `gui`. This parameters includes settings such as number of features to track, Quality of optical flow, and filtering parameters.

## Data Format

The monocular (inertial) visual odometry system supports the following data formats:

- Image formats: JPEG, PNG
- Inertial sensor data: CSV, TXT
- Ground truth data: CSV, TXT

<!-- [Input Data Guidelines](./docs/data_format.md) -->
