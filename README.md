# Monocular (Inertial) Visual Odometry for Drones

This project focuses on developing a monocular (inertial) visual odometry system for drone navigation. The goal is to provide accurate and robust localization capabilities using only visual and inertial sensor data.


## Overview

Monocular (inertial) visual odometry is a technique that combines information from a single camera and inertial sensors to estimate the drone's motion and position. This repository implements a system that leverages these sensors to achieve reliable and precise navigation for drones.
